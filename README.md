## Design

It integrates data and information application-wide to create a fully functional and efficient dealership data-management platform. The three microservices are Service, Sales, and Inventory.

## Service microservice
    Explain your models and integration with the inventory
    microservice, here.

    The service microservice provides a way for a dealership to track service appointments, appointment history, technicians, customers, and date-times. This service integrates with inventory and sales to allow the tracking of whether a vehicle has been sold. The service appointments allow tracking based on status, whether it has been created, finished or canceled.

    There is a poller set up which communicates with the inventory service to create value objects based off of inventory objects stored in the database. This allows the service microservice to have a reference for automobiles that have have been sold, giving those customers VIP status when creating a service appointment.
